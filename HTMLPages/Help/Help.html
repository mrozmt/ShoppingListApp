      <p>Choose the <i>Create a Shopping List</i> from the main menu. In the
        next screen you will see a list of ordinary shopping items which can be
        added to the list. You can type in the search bar or scroll up and down
        and choose one which will take you to the next screen. From here select the
        quantity wanted for that item and click <i>Add Item</i> button to add it to
        the current list. This can be repeated until your shopping list has been
        finished. At the bottom of the screen there is a footer which contains the

            the lists that you have previously saved. A list of all the shopping lists
            will be presented to you. Choose one of them. Whne you enter the shopping
            list, you will see a screen similar to the image below.</p>
            <img src="Images/ShoppingListItems.png" alt="Shopping List Items" style="width:100%;">

              list. To view the bought items you have to click the <i>Bought Items</i>
              button at the top. If an item is clicked by mistake this can be removed
              from the bought list by clicking on it. When you are ready press the
              <i>Ready</i> button at the top which will present you a popup as shown

                another time or whether you want to remove it. Please note that if
                removed the list cannot be retrieved. If the list is kept all the items
                in the bought list will be moved back to the shopping list. Moreover,
                in both cases, the items found in the bought list will be saved so
                that they can be viewed later in the report page.</p>
